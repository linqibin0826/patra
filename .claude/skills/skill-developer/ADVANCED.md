# Advanced Topics & Future Enhancements

Ideas and concepts for future improvements to the skill system.

---

## Dynamic Rule Updates

**Current State:** Requires Claude Code restart to pick up changes to skill-rules.json

**Future Enhancement:** Hot-reload configuration without restart

**Implementation Ideas:**
- Watch skill-rules.json for changes
- Reload on file modification
- Invalidate cached compiled regexes
- Notify user of reload

**Benefits:**
- Faster iteration during skill development
- No need to restart Claude Code
- Better developer experience

---

## Skill Dependencies

**Current State:** Skills are independent

**Future Enhancement:** Specify skill dependencies and load order

**Configuration Idea:**
```json
{
  "my-advanced-skill": {
    "dependsOn": ["prerequisite-skill", "base-skill"],
    "type": "domain",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Advanced skill builds on base skill knowledge
- Ensure foundational skills loaded first
- Chain skills for complex workflows

**Benefits:**
- Better skill composition
- Clearer skill relationships
- Progressive disclosure

## Conditional Enforcement

**Current State:** Enforcement level is static

**Future Enhancement:** Enforce based on context or environment

**Configuration Idea:**
```json
{
  "enforcement": {
    "default": "suggest",
    "when": {
      "production": "block",
      "development": "suggest",
      "ci": "block"
    }
  }
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Stricter enforcement in production
- Relaxed rules during development
- CI/CD pipeline requirements

**Benefits:**
- Environment-appropriate enforcement
- Flexible rule application
- Context-aware guardrails

## Skill Analytics

**Current State:** No usage tracking

**Future Enhancement:** Track skill usage patterns and effectiveness

**Metrics to Collect:**
- Skill trigger frequency
- False positive rate
- False negative rate
- Time to skill usage after suggestion
- User override rate (skip markers, env vars)
- Performance metrics (execution time)

**Dashbord Ideas:**
- Most/least used skills
- Skills with highest false positive rate
- Performance bottlenecks
- Skill effectiveness scores

**Benefits:**
- Data-driven skill improvement
- Identify problems early
- Optimize patterns based on real usage

---

## Skill Versioning

**Current State:** No version tracking

**Future Enhancement:** Version skills and track compatibility

**Configuration Idea:**
```json
{
  "my-skill": {
    "version": "2.1.0",
    "minClaudeVersion": "1.5.0",
    "changelog": "Added support for new workflow patterns",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Track skill evolution
- Ensure compatibility
- Document changes
- Support migration paths

---

## Multi-Language Support

**Current State:** English only

**Future Enhancement:** Support multiple languages for skill content

**Implementation Ideas:**
- Language-specific SKILL.md variants
- Automatic language detection
- Fallback to English

**Use Cases:**
- International teams
- Localized documentation
- Multi-language projects

---

## Skill Testing Framework

**Current State:** Manual testing with hook scripts

**Future Enhancement:** Automated skill testing

**Features:**
- Test cases for trigger patterns
- Assertion framework
- CI/CD integration
- Coverage reports

**Example Test Concept:**
```
Test: mybatis-query-verification
  ✓ triggers on MyBatis imports
  ✓ triggers on @Mapper annotation
  ✓ triggers on BaseMapper interface
  ✓ blocks when mapper file edited
  ✓ allows when session skill used
  ✓ allows when @skip-validation present
```

**Implementation Options:**
- Shell script test framework (e.g., bats)
- JUnit tests for Java hook implementations
- TypeScript tests for TS hook implementations
- Generic JSON-based test cases

**Benefits:**
- Prevent regressions
- Validate patterns before deployment
- Confidence in changes
- Cross-language support
